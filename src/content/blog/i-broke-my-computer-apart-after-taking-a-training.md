When I walked into the training company I had signed up a month for, I wasn't 
expecting much of an internship experience. When you think about it, most 
internships offered at a price are pretty much predictable; you meet instructors, 
they teach you in a classroom-like format for three or four days, you get the 
certificate that you shelled out a few thousand bucks for, you go home, and 
eventually, you forget what you learned.

This place was more or less the same. An Embedded Systems training company based 
in Kochi. In my junior year, I was taken in as a trainee there in Raspberry Pi. 
I had always wanted to learn and make and break with Pi. When we started, it 
was better than my expectations. The trainers had a conversational style even 
as they introduced me to Raspberry Pi with Image Processing. We had Digital 
Image Processing as a subject in class, but I had never been good at it.

With this refreshed approach and hands-on training, I developed a genuine 
interest in making. They taught me the basics. I developed a certain love for 
Linux. In a fit of sudden renewed enthusiasm, I decided to up the game. My first 
mission was to replace the Windows OS on my computer with Linux, in the process 
of which I ended up breaking it. That wasn't a problem, because I soon picked it 
up. I fixed it and learned to install it correctly.

I became fairly good at Linux over the days. And you know what the best part was? 
I was actually able to put all my theoretical knowledge into practice at work. 
It was incredible because sadly, it is very rare that students in my league get 
to put into practice something that they learn about in class.

In a few days, I started toying with the idea of a project using Pi and Image 
Processing. I grew skilled in Python. And then I built that project I had been 
contemplating for some time. A Document Scanner based on Python that scans notes 
using the camera on a laptop. It was a fairly good project, one that had happened 
entirely because I had decided to learn something new.

I have to say, I did not learn everything completely from the institution that 
I went to, or the trainers I listened to. A lot of it was self-taught, and the 
training was an enabler; one that put me in an environment that was all about 
making and creating and learning.

Also, learning from people who are about the same age as you, makes so much 
impact. I wouldn't have had the courage to openly ask simple questions to 
someone who was distinguished and experienced. But here, it was different. By 
the end of the one-month training, I was enriched in more ways than one.

> If you did not land that prized internship offer and have to pay for 
training in the summer, don't be disheartened. There are plenty of things that 
can come out of it if you have the will to learn and build and rebuild.

By senior year, I became identified as a technical person; I was helping other 
people with their image processing projects. After college, I also worked at the 
training company as a trainer for about three weeks, passing on my learning to my peers.

Learning is the single most essential food for growth. No matter where you are 
â€” in college, in a job, 20 years from now, that bit still stays relevant.
